The goal of this script is to convert the VASP XDATCAR to .arc., which can be visualized in Material Studio.
Usage:
1. make sure you have xdat2xyz.pl and pos2xyz.pl in your $PATH (e.g., ~/bin/). These files can be downloaded at http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/code/vtstscripts.tgz. I also attached them here.
2. chmod +x xdat2arc.sh
3. ./xdat2arc.sh
